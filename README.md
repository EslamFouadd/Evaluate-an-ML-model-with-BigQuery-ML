# Overview
BigQuery ML enables users to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery using SQL queries. The goal is to democratise machine learning by enabling SQL practitioners to build models using their existing tools and to increase development speed by eliminating the need for data movement.

The ecommerce dataset has millions of Google Analytics records for the Google Merchandise Store loaded into BigQuery, which you will use in this lab to create a model that predicts whether a visitor will make a transaction.

# Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

Create a machine learning model in BigQuery

Evaluate a machine learning model in BigQuery

Use a machine learning model in BigQuery

# Model information & training statistics
